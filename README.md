# Command-Line
A python program to be ran through the command line.

'commandline.py' is a program to be ran through the command line. The program takes in the information provided CSV files, compiles the information, and creates a Json file to display the compiled information.

The information contained within the individual CSVs are students enrolled in a curriculum. The 'students' have a name, id number. The 'courses' have an id number, class name, and teacher name. The 'tests' contain an id number, the class id number to which the test(s) belong, and a weight associated with the test. Finally, the 'marks' has the test id, the id of the student who took the test, and the grade said student received for the course.

Consequently, the programmer has to keep track of all the id numbers floating around, whether or not a student has taken the full course load, and develop logic for when a student has not taken the full course load.

Some things I learned 

Please note:
  While the program runs as expected, I have not yet taken steps to make sure all the fields have been properly filled out, check whether or not correct
